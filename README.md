# Hi, I'm Gavin Reider

I'm an undergraduate at Cornell University studying Mathematics and Physics (Class of 2026). I'm interested in stochastic processes, scientific computing, and data-driven modeling.

My current focus is on how random fluctuations at the microscopic scale can reveal important thermodynamic structure. I also explore how similar mathematical tools can be used in financial modeling.

### Recent Work
- **Experimental Determination of Boltzmann’s Constant**  
  I used particle tracking and video microscopy to analyze the Brownian motion of microspheres in water. I created Python-based analysis pipelines to estimate Boltzmann’s constant using both sedimentation equilibrium and Einstein-Smoluchowski diffusion models.
